# python-template

A python template for personal research use.

This template is motivated by [lightning-hydra-template](https://github.com/ashleve/lightning-hydra-template/tree/main), but we cleaned up the code and and make it for general research use.

In the future, we will add more features such as Docker and GitHub workflow. See a similar template like [here](https://github.com/cvpaperchallenge/Ascender).
